This is a collection of level sets for the Chip's Challange Planner

c4 is the perl script to convert between level formats.

For example classical.txt was generated from classical.dat with the command:

c4 classical.dat classical.txt

TXT level format information is here: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/hardy/man6/c4.6.html
