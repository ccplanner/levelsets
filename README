This is a collection of level sets for the Chip's Challange Planner
It can be copied directlly into a tile world source code checkout
and it will put the files in the correct directories

The data directory has the levelsets, and the sets directory has the *.dac
files which tell Tile World about the levelsets (which ruleset to use).

c4 is the perl script to convert between level formats.

For example classical.txt was generated from classical.dat with the command:

c4 data/classical.dat classical.txt

TXT level format information is here: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/hardy/man6/c4.6.html
